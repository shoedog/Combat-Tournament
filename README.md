# Combat-Tournament
C++ Combat Game Tournament with Multiple Character Objects and Inheritance

For this project, I created a basic character class and implemented inheritance to create several different types of character classes with unique characteristics. I then set up a system to let player's choose the characters for their teams and have them battle.
